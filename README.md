# About Bernoulli

This is a set of processing scripts investigating
Bernoulli random variables.

## Details
The Bernoulli(*p*) distribution is used to model a coin toss  or any other single event where there are only two possible outcomes: success/failure, head/tails, true/false, yes/no, and so on. The *p* represents the probability of success, so for a coin toss, you have Bernoulli(0.5).

In this depiction, each pixel represents the opportunity for success or failure. I represent success by placing a dark pixel.

There are different variations in the code.
